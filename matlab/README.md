# BSDF Matlab/Octave implementation

This is the implementation of the BSDF format for Matlab/Octave. It's
in good shape and well tested. Though it could do with some love from 
a Matlab expert to optimize the code and/or improve the implementation,
e.g. by allowing custom converters.

## Installation

Download [bsdf.m](bsdf.m) and place it in a directory where Matlab can find it,
e.g. by doing:

```matlab
addpath('/path/to/bsdf');
```

## Development

Run `invoke -l` in this directory for available tasks (like tests).
